# Variables



## Functions
We provide the following methods to provide a compositional approach for defining common variables used in power flow models. These methods should always be defined over "GenericPowerModel", from the base PowerModels.jl.

```@autodocs
Modules = [PowerModelsACDC]
Pages   = ["core/variableconv.jl", "core/variabledcgrid.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
Private  = true
```
